## Abstract
This field experiment aims to evaluate whether message prompts, promoting the benefits of limiting social media usage, will affect subjects’ daily social media mobile app usage and their emotional wellbeing, and whether such effects, if any, are sustained post-treatment. To this purpose, a two-week experiment was conducted in which participants were randomly assigned to either control or a one-week treatment period. Observations consisting of participants daily app usage of either Facebook, Instagram or WeChat, and their emotional states were made pre-treatment, after the first week of treatment, and in the week after treatment. The treatment was administered via online surveys, and the specific app usage times were collected through screenshots from participants’ screen time apps from their mobile phones’ operating systems. The results of the study show that there are no statistically significant effect of message prompts being able to discourage usage times on Facebook, Instagram and WeChat, both during the one-week treatment period and in the post-treatment week. There is also no statistically significant treatment effect on participants’ emotional states from the measurements made during the two weeks of the experiment.
